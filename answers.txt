What does fast-forward in Git mean?
If a branch is not diverged from the new branch created and instead of commiting if git can just move the pointer to the latest commit then it is called fast forwarding
For example if we create a branch from master branch and in some point of time when we want to merge subbranch with master 
git will move HEAD pointer of master to the sub branch commit given the master branch hasn't diverged.


Why should you have different branches?
By having different branches we can deal with multiple problems parallely in different branches and when they are done they can just merge it to the main branch.

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
We can have as many repositories as we need but we will have one default remote repository created by github which is origin.
